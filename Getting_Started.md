## If you just received your EmotiBit
### Unboxing
<img src="./assets/emotibit-outOfBox.png" align="right" width="350">

Welcome to the World of EmotiBit. If you just received your EmotiBit, in the box you will find:
- EmotiBit with straps
- Adafruit feather M0 WiFi, programmed and ready to use
- Micro SD-Card with SD-Card adapter
- Micro SD-Card USB reader
- 3.7V battery
- 2 snaps with Ag-AgCl coated studs + 2 extra snaps(can be used to attach external electrodes)


### Connecting to WiFi

- <details><summary><b>Adding WiFi credentials to SD-Card</b></summary>

  - To connect the EmotiBit to WiFi, you have to add the WiFi credentials`SSID: WIFi Name` and `Password: WiFi Password` to a file named `config.txt` on the SD-Card provided. **Note**: _FAT32 is important for the EmotiBit to function as designed_ 
  - If you got your SD-card with your EmotiBit, it's already in the FAT32 format. 
  - If using an SD-Card **other** than the one provided in the box, please **make sure it is formatted to be FAT32**. If it is not in **FAT32** format, follow the instructions below to Format the SD-Card
  - <details><summary>Formatting to FAT32</summary>

    - Download [SD Memory Card Formatter](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/)
    - You can use SD Memory Card Formatter to format the SD-Card into FAT32 format. 
    </details>

  - Create a **config.txt** file on the SD-Card.
  - The contents of the file should be in format as shown below:
  - ``{"WifiCredentials": [{"ssid": "Foo", "password" : "Bar"}]}`` (_Just copy and paste this line in the **config.txt** file on the SD-Card_)
  - Replace `Foo` with the `WiFi name` and `Bar` with the `WiFi password`.

  - <details><summary><b>Access multiple WiFi networks</b>(EmotiBit FeatherWing v0.5.4+)</summary>
 
    - a JSON list can be used to store up to 12 sets of network credentials in config.txt:
      - ``{"WifiCredentials": [{"ssid": "Foo", "password" : "Bar"},{"ssid": "Fnord", "password" : "Baz"}]}`` (_Just copy and paste this line in the **config.txt** file on the SD-Card_)
      - Replace `Foo` with the `WiFi 1 name` and `Bar` with the `WiFi 1 password`. Replace `Fnord` with the `WiFi 2 name` and `Baz` with the `WiFi 2 password`
    - In the setup of EmotiBit_Example, all the WiFi networks are tried sequentially, a process that times out at ~1min. If a quick connection is desired after programming or reset:
      - Shorten the list
      - Organize the list in order of priority of the connection
    </details>
  - After your SD-Card is setup and ready for use, insert it into the EmotiBit SD-Card slot. 
  </details>

> For quick reference:<br>
> The config.txt file should shoud contain the contents in the following format <br>
> `{"WifiCredentials": [{"ssid": "Foo", "password" : "Bar"}]}`
- **Note: EmotiBit only supports the 2.4GHz band for WiFi.**

### Powering Up
- Stack the Feather with the EmotiBit(12 pin connector goes into the 12 pin socket and the 16 pin connector goes into the 16 pin socket).
- Plug in the 3.7V battery provided with the EmotiBit. We recommend that you plug in the Micro-USB cable too, as this will begin recharging the battery, which will be indicated by the YELLOW light on the Adafruit Feather.t]
![][EmotiBit-stackup]
- If the EmotiBit does not automatically start when you plug in the battery, press the reset button(black push-button below the USB connector) on the feather.
- Wait for the EmotiBit to run through the setup.
  - The EmotiBit momentarily lights up RED, YELLOW and then BLUE light in sequence as it goes through the bootup. The boot-up may take longer depending on time taken to connect to WiFi.
  - The Wifi Shield gets activated next, indicated with a green light at the bottom on the feather.(see image in the section below for reference)
- Open the EmotiBit Oscilloscope you installed in the previous steps.
  - **You should see the Data start to stream on the Oscilloscope!!**

## Troubleshooting
- <details>
  <summary>LEDs and the serial monitor can be useful tools for debugging</summary>
  <br>
  
  - if the green _WiFi Connected_ LED is on, the feather is connected to WiFi
  - if the yellow _Network Traffic_ LED flashes at all, it suggests that the EmotiBit is exchanging packets with ofxEmotiBit
  </details>
- <details>
  <summary>Things to check for:</summary>
  <br>
  
  - Make sure the SD-Card contains the **config.txt** file.
  - Verify if the **WiFi-Name** and **WiFi-Password** are correctly entered in the config file.
