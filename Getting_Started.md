## Assembling your EmotiBit
### Adding WiFi credentials
<img src="./assets/SD-CardInReader.jpg" align="right" width="250">

- Plug in the USB card reader loaded with the SD-Card into the computer.
- Download the config file from https://www.emotibit.com/files/config.
- Open the config file in any text editor (e.g. Notepad on Windows or text edit on macOS).
- Add your WiFi credentials by replacing `YOUR_WIFI_NAME_GOES_HERE` to the name of your WiFi network and change `YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD_GOES_HERE`to the password for your WiFi network. 
  - <img src="./assets/config-file-example.png" width="550">
- Save the file onto your microSD card. Eject the SD-Card from your computer. 

- <details><summary>Multiple WiFi credentials</summary>

  - If you use multiple WiFi networks and want your EmotiBit to automatically connect to whichever one is in range, simply add both networks to the WifiCredentials array in the config file like this:<br> 
  ```
  {
    "WifiCredentials": [
      {
        "ssid": "wifi_1",
        "password": "password1"
      },
      {
        "ssid": "wifi_2",
        "password": "password2"
      },
      {
        "ssid": "wifi_3",
        "password": "password3"
      },
      {
        "ssid": "wifi_4",
        "password": "password4"
      },
    ]
  }
  ```
  </details>

**Note: Currently EmotiBit only supports the 2.4GHz band for WiFi and does not support enterprise networks (that require a login/password after connecting).** This is due to HW/FW limitations of the presently supported Adafruit Feather M0 WiFi.

### Stack your EmotiBit!

- On the EmotiBit
  - Insert the SD-Card into the EmotiBit.
  - Make sure the sliding switch (*Hibernate switch*) is set to the active (not HIB) position as shown *(Available on only EmotiBit version V4)*.
    - ```diff
      - CAUTION: Excessive force can break the HIB switch. Handle with care! -
      ```
    - <img src="./assets/correctHibernateSwitch.jpg" width="250">


- Plug the battery into the Feather (**ensure the connector is firmly pushed all the way into the Feather connector**)
- Stack the Feather with EmotiBit (*12 pin connector goes into the 12 pin socket and the 16 pin connector goes into the 16 pin socket*)

### Run EmotiBit Firmware Installer
- You will need the `EmotiBit FirmwareInstaller`, which comes with the EmotiBit software bundle.
  - If you have not done so already, follow [these steps to grab the latest EmotiBit software](#Installing-EmotiBit-Software). 
- Open the `EmotiBit FirmwareInstaller`. 
  - Follow the instructions mentioned in the [section above](#Running-EmotiBit-software) to start using `EmotiBit FirmwareInstaller`
- After you start the application, follow the on-screen instructions to complete installing the firmware.
- Screengrab from `EmotiBitFirmwareInstaller`
  - <img src="./assets/EmotiBitFirmwareInstaller-step1.png" width="600">
- <details><summary> Installing custom firmware</summary>

  - The `EmotiBit FirmwareInstaller` installs the stock firmware provided in the software bundle.
    - Each software release bundles specific firmware version that can be found in the [software release notes](https://github.com/emotibit/ofxemotibit/releases/latest). 
  - If you wish to install a custom firmware or an older firmware release, you can do so using the "Load" provision in the Firmware Installer.
  - To do so, 
    - Press `L` on the first screen on the Firmware Installer (You may also notice that the Firmware Installer has a footnote with the same prompt)
    - Choose the file (`.bin`) you want to install on EmotiBit
    - After selecting the file, you will return to the original Firmware Installer screen
    - Continue with normal installation process
  - For example, you may grab an earlier release from the [EmotiBit firmware release page](https://github.com/EmotiBit/EmotiBit_FeatherWing/releases), and install that firmware using the `Load` function in the EmotiBit Installer.
  - Alternatively, you can write your own custom firmware and create a binary. You can then use the Firmware Installer to install that binary.
  - **WARNING**: Make sure that the firmware you are trying to install has been written for the correct board version. 
Installing incompatible firmware may lead to un-expected behavior, or worse, may brick your device.
  </details>

## For Linux and Advanced Users
- <details><summary> Installing Emotibit Firmware on Feather M0 WiFi</summary>
  
  - **Note**: on macOS, you will need to give the `EmotiBit FirmwareInatller` application permissions to run the contained executables. To do so, right click on the `EmotiBit FirmwareInstaller` app and click on Open. This will open the application but you may close it to proceed below.
  - The FirmwareInstaller essentaily performs 3 actions:
    1. Uploads the firmware updater sketch to prep the Feather for WINC updater
    2. Updates the WINC WiFi module FW to version 19.6.1
    3. Uploads the latest EmotiBit FW onto the Feather, after the WINC has been updated
  - We use the [`bossac`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/bossac.1.html) command line tool to upload binary files to the feather.
  - There are 2 requirements to run bossac
    - COM port on which the Feather is detected
    - The bin file (*provided in the software release*). If your flavor of Linux doesn't work with the provided bin file, you'll have to download/compile `bossac` yourself, but ***WARNING: THAR BE DRAGONS***
      - Check out these [instructions on installing bossac](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m0-express-designed-for-circuit-python-circuitpython/uf2-bootloader-details#running-bossac-on-the-command-line-2929769-30). ***PLEASE NOTE*** that with bossac version 1.9 or later, you must give an --offset parameter on the command line to specify where to start writing the firmware in flash memory. ***FAILING TO DO SO WILL BRICK YOUR FEATHER!***
  - To perform the operations manually, the follow the below listed steps:
    - Navigate to the `data` folder located inside the EmotiBit software directory.
      - On Linux the path to the data folder should look like `EmotiBitSoftware-linux/ofxEmotiBit/EmotiBitFirmwareInstaller/bin/data`
      - On MacOS the path should look like `EmotiBitSoftware-macOS/EmotiBitFirmwareInstaller.app/Contents/Resources`
      - On Windows the path will be `C:\Program Files\EmotiBit\EmotiBit FirmwareInstaller\data`
    - Open a `cmd prompt` window for Windows or `terminal` for Linux/Mac at this location
    - Connect the Feather to the computer using a data-capable USB cable
      - **The Feather should NOT be stacked with EmotiBit** (to enable the programmer mode LED)
    - Double-press the reset button to set the Feather in programmer mode.
      - You should see the RED LED on the Feather pulsating!
        - [ToDo: add gif]
    - **WARNING: DO NOT UNPLUG OR RESET FEATHER WHILE UPLOAD/UPDATE IN PROGRESS. YOU COULD BRICK YOUR FEATHER!**
    - Upload the firmware updater sketch by running the following command (*use .\bossac.exe for windows*, *use ./bossac for macOS*)
      - `./bossac_linux -i -d --port=YOUR_FEATHER_COM_PORT -U true -i -e -w -v ./WINC/FirmwareUpdater.ino.feather_m0.bin -R`
        - [For linux] If you get a `permission denied` error, run the command `chmod u+x ./bossac_linux`, to make the file executable.
    - Update the WINC by running (*use .\FirmwareUploader.exe for windows*, *use ./FirmwareUploader for macOS*)
      - `./WINC/FirmwareUploader_linux -port YOUR_FEATHER_COM_PORT -firmware ./WINC/m2m_aio_3a0.bin`
        - [For linux] If you get a `permission denied` error, run the command `chmod u+x ./WINC/FirmwareUploader_linux` , to make the file executable.
    - ONLY AFTER the FirmwareUploader command completes, double-press the reset button to set the Feather in programmer mode again
    - Upload the EmotiBit FW using (*use .\bossac.exe for windows*, *use ./bossac for macOS*)
      - `./bossac_linux -i -d --port=YOUR_FEATHER_COM_PORT -U true -i -e -w -v EmotiBit_stock_firmware.ino.feather_m0.bin -R`
  </details> 

- <details><summary> Installing Emotibit Firmware on Feather ESP32 Huzzah</summary>
  
  - **Note**: on macOS, you will need to give the `EmotiBit FirmwareInatller` application permissions to run the contained executables. To do so,
  right click on the `EmotiBit FirmwareInstaller` app and click on Open. This will open the application but you may close it to proceed below.
  - The FirmwareInstaller essentaily uploads the latest EmotiBit FW onto the Feather
  - We use the [`esptool`](https://github.com/espressif/esptool/releases/tag/v3.3) command line tool to upload binary files to the feather.
  - There are 2 requirements to run esptool
    - COM port on which the Feather is detected
    - The esptool bin file (*provided in the software release*).
  - To perform the operations manually, the follow the below listed steps:
    - Navigate to the `data` folder located inside the EmotiBit software directory.
      - On Linux the path to the data folder should look like `EmotiBitSoftware-linux/ofxEmotiBit/EmotiBitFirmwareInstaller/bin/data`
      - On MacOS the path should look like `EmotiBitSoftware-macOS/EmotiBitFirmwareInstaller.app/Contents/Resources`
      - On Windows the path will be `C:\Program Files\EmotiBit\EmotiBit FirmwareInstaller\data`
    - Open a `cmd prompt` window for Windows or `terminal` for Linux/Mac at this location
    - Connect the Feather to the computer using a data-capable USB cable.
      - The Feather should show up as a COM port on the system.
        - On `Windows`: The device appears with a same similiar to `COM X` (where `X` is a number)
        - On `mac/linux`: You may find the COM port by running the terminal command `ls -la /dev/tty*`
        - Pro-tip for linux: the Feather may likely show up as `/dev/ttyUSB0`
    - **WARNING: DO NOT UNPLUG OR RESET FEATHER WHILE UPLOAD/UPDATE IN PROGRESS. YOU COULD BRICK YOUR FEATHER!**
    - replace **YOUR_FEATHER_PORT** with the COM port you detected in the previous step in the following command and run it to upload the firmware.
      - `./exec/linux/esptool --chip esp32 --port YOUR_FEATHER_PORT --baud 921600 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash -z --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 80m --flash_size 4MB 0x1000 ./esp32/EmotiBit_stock_firmware.ino.bootloader.bin 0x8000 ./esp32/EmotiBit_stock_firmware.partitions.bin 0xe000 ./esp32/boot_app0.bin 0x10000 ./EmotiBit_stock_firmware.ino.feather_esp32.bin`
        - [For linux] If you get a `permission denied` error, run the command `chmod u+x ./exec/esptool`, to make the file executable.
        - [For Windows] replace `./exec/linux/esptool` with `.\exec\win\esptool.exe`. You will also need to change all file paths to `.\esp32\name-of-file`
        - [For macOS] replace `./exec/linux/esptool` with `./exec/mac/esptool`.
