## EmotiBit HW
### LEDs and Buttons
<img src="assets/M0_WiFi_LED_Indicators_01.png" align="right" width=500>

- **LED's on the EmotiBit:** As shown in the Images above, The EmotiBit FeatherWing has 3 LEDs to indicate its present status.
  - RED: Blinks at ~1Hz when recording
  - BLUE: Steady-on when connected to the EmotiBit Oscilloscope
  - Yellow: Steady-on when the battery level is low

- **LED's on the Adafruit Feather M0 WiFi:** In addition to the EmotiBit LEDs, the Feather has 4 indicator LED's 
  - RED: Is the I2C SCL Line. Under regular Operation, it should be always ON
  - ORANGE: This is the Charging indicator, which glows if a battery is connected to the feather and is being charged by the USB connection
  - GREEN: This is the WiFi indicator. If the EmotiBit is Connected to Wifi, there should be a constant glow.
  - YELLOW: It blinks whenever the EmotiBit receives a message from the computer. This blinks periodically when an EmotiBit Oscilloscope executable is running on the network.

- **Buttons on the EmotiBit**
  - EmotiBit Button: _adjacent to the SD card_
    - Long Press (3 sec) to put EmotiBit into hibernate mode
    - Short Press- Switch between WiFi modes. In future will support mapping to different functionality.
  - Reset button on the feather resets the board and restarts the code

## EmotiBit FW
### Update Feather WiFi chip firmware
  - Occasionally there are important updates to the Feather WiFi chip firmware. **If you recently got your Feather M0 WiFi board from us, you're up-to-date and good-to-go**, [but if not you should follow these instructions on Adafruit's page.](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m0-wifi-atwinc1500/using-the-wifi-module)

### Raw data packet architecture

- `TIMESTAMP`-`PACKET#`-`#DATAPOINTS`-`TYPETAG`-`VERSION`-`RELIABILITY`-`PAYLOAD`
  - **Timestamp:** milliseconds since start of EmotiBit
  - **Packet Number:** packet count since start of EmotiBit
  - **Number of Datapoints:** Number of data points in the payload
  - **Typetag:** type of data being sent
  - **Version:** version of packet protocol
  - **Reliability:** data reliability score out of 100, currently always 100
  - **Payload:** data to send
- Example Packets:

## EmotiBit SW
### How is Data Stored on the SD Card 
- CSV: Experimental Data
  - All data is saved to the SD card into a .csv file when recording is initiated from the GUI
  - The file is named with the date-time that the recording started
    -   An example file name can be `2019-01-30_11-57-13-492.csv`
- JSON: Configuration Settings
  - Information about the configuration of the hardware and firmware are written to a .json file also on the SD card
  - The file is named with the date-time that the recording started
    - 2019-01-30_11-57-13-492_info.json

### A Note on LSL

- EmotiBit is currently able to recieve a single multichannel LSL stream via communication with [ofxEmotiBit](https://github.com/EmotiBit/ofxEmotiBit/releases)
- ofxEmotiBit makes use of the openFrameworks addon [ofxLSL](https://github.com/badfishblues/ofxLSL) which has further documentation and examples in its own git repository
- The resolve stream argument is currently hardcoded in the main of ofxEmotiBit to **"name = 'CFL'"**, which means that the outlet stream that is being sent must have this name, or the GUI will not be able to find it
- While running ofxEmotiBit, the terminal window will display updates on when a connection to the stream occurred
```
[notice ] ofxLSL::update()
[notice ] ofxLSL::connect()
[notice ] Connecting to CFL at 0 hz 
```
- Each LSL marker has 3 timestamps associated with it:
  - **timestamp (TS):** _lsl_clock()_ time associated with the tag on the computer that sent the tag
  - **timestampLocal (TSC):** _timestamp + inlet->time_correction(1)_, an estimation of the _lsl_clock()_ time on the recieving computer equivalent to the TS
  - **localClock (LC):** _lsl_clock()_ after the _pull_sample()_
- LD is the payload of an LM and can be multiple channels
- LSL times are not unix times, but rather in seconds since your computer was turned on
- Crosstimes (TX) for LSL include a TL and an LC at the given instance
  - LC is an _lsl_clock()_ call at the time of the TX
  - Note that any conversion from the LSL time system to an external system could seriously hamper the accuracy and effectiveness of LSL
#### Accuracy

- **TS** is 100% accurate
- **TSC** periodicity is at worst accurate to 1.8ms
  - _average:_ 19 microseconds
  - defined as {TSC(n) - TSC(n-1)} - {TSsender(n) - TSsender(n-1)}
- **LC** periodicity is rather unreliable (>300ms)
  - Can be more accurate on same computer
