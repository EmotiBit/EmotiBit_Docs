### A Note on LSL

- EmotiBit is currently able to recieve a single multichannel LSL stream via communication with [ofxEmotiBit](https://github.com/EmotiBit/ofxEmotiBit/releases)
- ofxEmotiBit makes use of the openFrameworks addon [ofxLSL](https://github.com/badfishblues/ofxLSL) which has further documentation and examples in its own git repository
- The resolve stream argument is currently hardcoded in the main of ofxEmotiBit to **"name = 'CFL'"**, which means that the outlet stream that is being sent must have this name, or the GUI will not be able to find it
- While running ofxEmotiBit, the terminal window will display updates on when a connection to the stream occurred

- Each LSL marker has 3 timestamps associated with it:
  - **timestamp (TS):** _lsl_clock()_ time associated with the tag on the computer that sent the tag
  - **timestampLocal (TSC):** _timestamp + inlet->time_correction(1)_, an estimation of the _lsl_clock()_ time on the recieving computer equivalent to the TS
  - **localClock (LC):** _lsl_clock()_ after the _pull_sample()_
- LD is the payload of an LM and can be multiple channels
- LSL times are not unix times, but rather in seconds since your computer was turned on
- Crosstimes (TX) for LSL include a TL and an LC at the given instance
  - LC is an _lsl_clock()_ call at the time of the TX
  - Note that any conversion from the LSL time system to an external system could seriously hamper the accuracy and effectiveness of LSL
#### Accuracy

- **TS** is 100% accurate
- **TSC** periodicity is at worst accurate to 1.8ms
  - _average:_ 19 microseconds
  - defined as {TSC(n) - TSC(n-1)} - {TSsender(n) - TSsender(n-1)}
- **LC** periodicity is rather unreliable (>300ms)
  - Can be more accurate on same computer
