### Close and re-open Arduino IDE
  - After installing boards or libraries you should close and re-open the Arduino Application to make sure the changes take effect.

## Programming the Feather
- In the Arduino program (IDE), open `File > Examples > EmotiBit FeatherWing > EmotiBit_Example`
  - <img src="./assets/arduino-choose_emotibit_example.png" width="450">
  - Alternatively you can double click the `EmotiBit_Example.ino` file presenst at the location:`Documents/Arduino/libraries/EmotiBit_FeatherWing/examples/Emotibit_Example/` 
- Put the Feather in programming mode by double clicking the reset button. You should see the red LED pulsing.
- In the `Emotibit_Example` Arduino window that opens, Choose `Tools > Board > “Adafruit Feather M0”`
- Choose `Tools > Port > [the correct port for your board]`
  - <img src="./assets/arduino-uploading_FW.png" width="450">

- Click “Upload” button.
  - <img src="./assets/Arduino_upload_button.png" width="350">

## Ready to go!
- Once your feather is successfully uploaded, you are ready to go! [Start working with your data](./Working_with_emotibit_data.md/#Real-Time-Streaming)

## About the WiFi shield
- Adafruit feather M0 works with the `ATWINC1500` for wireless communication. The `ATWINC` exists as a independent submodule to the feather
and might get updates which require a different set of instructions to be followed. 
  - If you are using the feather you received with the EmotiBit, everything is upto data. If you are using 
  a feather purchased independently, check out the documentation to [update the WiFi module](Learn_more_about_emotibit.md/#Update-Feather-WiFi-chip-firmware)
